                <li>Would they pay me if I solve this problem?</li>
              </ul>

It provides a realistic look at what share of market a business can reasonably capture in the next 3 – 5 years. To calculate the SOM, businesses need to account for competition, marketing strategies, pricing plans, and many other variables</p>
              <h4>Usual Practices</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Define your niche. It is important to filter your SOM. It is not just geographic or demographic representation of your customerbase. If you can include more parameters in terms of their preference, consumer behaviour, choices and hobbies, that makes a perfect market definition.</li>

                    <li>Consider who call would be your initial customers and how would you reach them</li>
