              <p>The term business model refers to a company's plan for making a profit. It identifies the products or services the business plans to sell, its identified target market, and any anticipated expenses.</p>
              <p>Business Models generally include information like products or services the business plans to sell, target markets, pricing strategies and any anticipated expenses. There are dozens of types of business models including retailers, manufacturers, fee-for-service, or freemium providers.</p>
              <p>A primary component of the business model is the value proposition. This is a description of the goods or services that a company offers and why they are desirable to customers or clients, ideally stated in a way that differentiates the product or service from its competitors.</p>
              <h4>In general, a business model explains four things:</h4>
                <ul>
                <li>What product or service a company will sell.</li>
                <li>How it intends to market that product or service.</li>
                <li>What kind of expenses the company will face.</li>
                <li>How the company expects to turn a profit.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>How to design a business model?</h4>
                <ul>
                <li>Outline one or several revenue streams, which are the different ways your company plans to generate earnings.</li>
                <li>Identify how your company will measure its success, like how much it costs to acquire a customer or how many repeat customers you'll have.</li>
                <li>Your business model should consider how big your potential customer base is.</li>
                <li>Your business model should have a clear value proposition, which is what makes it uniquely attractive to customers. </li>
                <li>Make a list of the fixed and variable expenses your business requires to function, and then figure out what prices you need to charge so your revenue will exceed those costs</li>
                </ul>
