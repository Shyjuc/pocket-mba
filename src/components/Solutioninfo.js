              <p>In a practical real life scenario, an investor learn more about you in this slide. They observe how intelligent you are, your knowledge background, technical skills, confidence level; everything that want to understand as an investor. This slide gives a key insight about it. From this slide, they decide whether they should remain passive or attentive for the remaining slides</p>
              <p>Most founders don’t get this. They are blind to it. The solution slide is the most important part of not only your pitch, but your business as well. Identifying and presenting the solution can make a world of difference in developing a business concept.</p>
              <h4>Best practices</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>One single sentence with perfect reasoning, how you solve</li>
                <li>Tell the second chapter of your story like how you worked on the solution.</li>
                <li>2-3 steps explanation how it works</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Don't do this</h4>
                <p>Remember you are addressing customer’s pain points here and you should bring their perspective here. That’s how you can make it more relatable and convincing to your investors. However, One possible mistake happens when you concentrate more on product features. Whatever you feel as a limitation in the features of a product might not be a painful customer problem. Or whatever you feel as a void in the market might not be a thing that addresses a customer problem</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Most common mistake: Speaking about a solution to a problem you have not mentioned in the previous slide</li>
                    <li>Again, are you really able to tell about it in simple 3-4 sentences or are you trying to detail a lot of things? Please rethink.</li>
                    <li>Speaking about an unwanted market opportunity statement</li>
                </ul>
