              <p>AT the end od every pitch deck it's your turn to ask for what you are expecting from the investors and how much share you are willing to dilute in exchange of that deal. You need to consider various factors while reacing to this figure. Even if you are asking for a short term cash burn, you need to cnonsider overall position of your company minimum 5-10years forward.</p>
              <p>Investors need confirmation that founders know their stuff. In other way, Investors are not just validating the viability of your idea, they need to trust you and make sure that investment is going into safe hands. The Competition slide should prove that founders are self-aware, mindful of what sets them apart from the rest of the crowd. They must be sold on that vision and believe that this team has a real chance to become a key player in the so pictured market.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>What stage of investment you are in. Are you bootstrapping or going forward for next level investment</li>

                <li>Future Role of investor in your company or any value addition or positive impact due to his presence in the company </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Please consider all above factors when you are confused on the proportion of the share dilution. </p>
              <h4>While considering the amount you need these factors are important.</h4>

                <li>How much money you are you seeking (a range is fine, such as “we are seeking $2-$3 million in financing”)</li>
